The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{\\\\thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},\\nissn={2057-3960},\\ndoi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3},\\nurl={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}\\n}\\n\", '@article{Jain2013,\\nauthor = {Jain, Anubhav and Ong, Shyue Ping and Hautier, Geoffroy and Chen, Wei and Richards, William Davidson and Dacek, Stephen and Cholia, Shreyas and Gunter, Dan and Skinner, David and Ceder, Gerbrand and Persson, Kristin a.},\\ndoi = {10.1063/1.4812323},\\nissn = {2166532X},\\njournal = {APL Materials},\\nnumber = {1},\\npages = {011002},\\ntitle = {{The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation}},\\nurl = {http://link.aip.org/link/AMPADS/v1/i1/p011002/s1\\\\&Agg=doi},\\nvolume = {1},\\nyear = {2013}\\n}', '@article{Petousis2017,\\nauthor={Petousis, Ioannis and Mrdjenovich, David and Ballouz, Eric\\nand Liu, Miao and Winston, Donald and Chen, Wei and Graf, Tanja\\nand Schladt, Thomas D. and Persson, Kristin A. and Prinz, Fritz B.},\\ntitle={High-throughput screening of inorganic compounds for the\\ndiscovery of novel dielectric and optical materials},\\njournal={Scientific Data},\\nyear={2017},\\nmonth={Jan},\\nday={31},\\npublisher={The Author(s)},\\nvolume={4},\\npages={160134},\\nnote={Data Descriptor},\\nurl={http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.134}\\n}']\n",

In binary classification models, the ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) score can be used to evaluate performance. It quantifies the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative instances across different decision thresholds. A higher ROC-AUC score (ranging from 0.5 to 1) indicates better performance, with 1 representing a perfect classifier and 0.5 indicating performance no better than random chance. There is a more detailed discussion here: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc.\n",
