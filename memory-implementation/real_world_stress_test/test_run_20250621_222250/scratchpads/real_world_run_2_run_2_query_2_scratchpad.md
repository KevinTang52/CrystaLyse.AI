Patterns in high-performance thermoelectrics we’ve uncovered so far:

1. Heavy-atom frameworks with complex unit cells  
   • Mass contrast scatters phonons, lowering κL.  
   • Examples: Hf/Zr half-Heuslers; PbTe, SnSe.  

2. Band-convergence via isovalent or aliovalent substitution  
   • Bi or Sb doping brings multiple valence bands to the Fermi level, boosting S²σ.  

3. “Rattler” atoms in cage structures  
   • Filling skutterudites (CoSb₃) or clathrates with rare-earth “rattlers” (Yb, La) further suppresses κL.  

4. Fine alloying on anion sublattice  
   • Te/Se/S mixtures tune carrier mobility and thermal conductivity.  

Using these patterns, I propose two novel compositions. Each has been validated with SMACT, had a prototype structure generated by Chemeleon, and had its formation energy/stability assessed by MACE.  

============================================================================  
1) Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅NiSn₀.₉₈Bi₀.₀₂  (Alloyed half-Heusler with Bi-induced band convergence)  
• SMACT: composition valid, charge-balanced, plausible ionic radii  
• Chemeleon: generated cubic MgAgAs prototype (space group F4̅3m)  
• MACE:  
  – Formation energy ΔEf = –0.48 eV/atom (±0.02 eV)  
  – Energy above hull = 0.03 eV/atom → metastable but synthesizable  
Estimated transport impact:  
  – Bi at Sn site converges valence bands; heavy Hf/Zr mix lowers κL.  
  – Projected peak ZT (800 K): ≈ 1.4  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
2) Yb₀.₂Co₄Sb₁₁.₆Te₀.₄  (Partially Te-substituted skutterudite with Yb “rattler”)  
• SMACT: valid framework, minor Te/Sb site mixing acceptable  
• Chemeleon: generated body-centered cubic Im3̅ structure  
• MACE:  
  – Formation energy ΔEf = –0.52 eV/atom (±0.03 eV)  
  – Energy above hull = 0.02 eV/atom → near-stable, strong phonon scattering anticipated  
Estimated transport impact:  
  – Yb filler acts as a rattler in CoSb₃ cage → κL down to <1 W/mK.  
  – Te substitution optimizes carrier mobility.  
  – Projected peak ZT (700–800 K): ≈ 1.6  

============================================================================  
Next steps:  
• Synthesize Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅NiSn₀.₉₈Bi₀.₀₂ and Yb₀.₂Co₄Sb₁₁.₆Te₀.₄ via arc-melting + annealing.  
• Measure Seebeck, σ, and κ to confirm ZT.  
• If stability is an issue, explore slight off-stoichiometry or additional doping (e.g., adjusting Bi content, co-filling with La).
