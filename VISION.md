## 🔄 The Discovery Paradigm Shift

### Traditional Materials Discovery
```
Literature Review → Hypothesis → Synthesis → Characterisation → Analysis
Timeline: 6-18 months per material
```

### CrystaLyse.AI Discovery
```
Natural Language Query → AI Reasoning → Computational Validation → Ranked Recommendations
Timeline: 2-5 minutes per batch of materials
```

This represents a **1000x acceleration** in the discovery timeline while maintaining scientific rigor through computational validation.
